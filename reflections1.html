      Ammon Fleming Points: 100 (I gave myself this score because I answered 100
      points worth of questions and I did them to the best of my ability and
      tried to really ponder about what I learned this week)

      I prepared for the class by having my computer ready and charged and
      coming with all the necessary materials I need to take notes and anything
      else. Also with a good attitude. I would like to know more about how you
      can work as a team on one code. For example, how to share code or what
      different aspects people work on. This week's scenario was learning about
      one another and what it takes to work as a team when computing. I learned
      that you can’t build code and work alone. This is a teamwork class and so
      it should be treated as such, we all need to work together. This week's
      topic was important because it’s our base for what we are learning and
      that's to work together and be in a team where we can solve more complex
      problems together. We did an activity where we tried to figure out what
      common symbol we all had on paper without seeing it. I played the part as
      a team member where I went to some of the higher people in charge and
      collaborated with them to figure out the solution. My biggest takeaway
      from this week's lesson was that I can't do this alone. I need a team of
      smart and capable people to be able to write complex lines of code. To
      someone not in the class I would explain to them the concept of teamwork
      and how we don’t have to do this work, coding or whatever else someone
      does, without the help of others. We are a small piece to the huge puzzle,
      is what i would tell them, that without others we can’t complete the
      puzzle. When I explain it to someone else it becomes a lot more clear that
      we can’t do anything alone in this life. We all need someone else. Even
      talking to the person shows that you need someone else to explain to, to
      truly understand the topic better. This topic relates to the doctrine that
      is taught in the gospel because Jesus Christ came down and went through so
      much pain and suffering so that we can have a better life and return to
      God. Jesus provided us with the Atonement so we could repent of our sins,
      which really shows that we can’t do it alone and we need others to help us
      move along and progress. I plan on being there for my teammates whenever
      they might be struggling and always offering my assistance when they might
      need more assistance in a subject. I am going to give my opinions and
      offer but not force my suggestions into the situation to a problem or
      project.
